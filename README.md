# 🧱 Decentralized File Storage (IPFS)

A **Web3-based decentralized storage system** that allows users to **upload and access files securely** using **IPFS** for file storage and the **Ethereum blockchain** for record verification.

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project bridges blockchain and distributed storage.  
Whenever a user uploads a file, it’s stored on IPFS and the corresponding **hash + metadata** are saved on the Ethereum blockchain for permanent record and verification.  
This ensures **security, transparency, and immutability** of file data.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a **fully decentralized file management system** where users have complete control and ownership over their data — free from centralized servers, censorship, or tampering.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure Storage:** IPFS ensures distributed, tamper-proof storage.
- 🌍 **Blockchain Integration:** Every file’s hash is verified and stored on-chain.
- 💡 **Transparency:** Anyone can verify uploaded files publicly.
- 🧾 **User-specific Records:** Each user can view only their uploaded files.
- 🚀 **Low Cost:** Uses Ethereum testnet (Sepolia) for minimal transaction cost.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 📦 Add **file encryption** before uploading.
- 🤝 Enable **file sharing** between blockchain users.
- 💰 Integrate **Polygon / Arbitrum** for cheaper gas fees.
- 🪙 Launch a **token reward system** for frequent users.
- 📱 Develop a **mobile-friendly DApp** for broader access.
